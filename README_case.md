## 📖 Overview

This case study explores how customer behavior evolves over time in a retail setting. By grouping customers into monthly cohorts based on when they made their first purchase, we gain a deeper understanding of how well the business retains users and how revenue from those users grows or declines over time.

## 📌 Key Insights (in plain English)

1. **One-time Shoppers Dominate:**  
   Most customers make only one purchase and never return. After the first month, retention drops drastically, meaning customers are not coming back to shop again.

2. **Some Customers Stick Around:**  
   A few customer groups, especially those who joined early, continued to make purchases over several months. These loyal customers represent a valuable segment that the business could focus more on.

3. **Later Customers Leave Sooner:**  
   Customers who joined in later months didn’t stick around for long. This could be a red flag pointing to issues like poor product experience, weaker marketing, or less attractive offers compared to earlier periods.

4. **Fewer Customers, More Money:**  
   Even though fewer customers continue buying over time, those who do spend more on average. This means a small group of highly loyal customers is driving a significant part of the revenue.

5. **Early Success, Later Decline:**  
   The customers acquired in the early months performed much better — they stayed longer and spent more. Later customers didn’t show the same behavior, suggesting that whatever was working earlier (marketing, product, promotions) might not be working anymore.

## 🧠 Business Takeaways

- **Improve Repeat Engagement:** Focus on keeping first-time shoppers engaged — a simple follow-up or personalized offer could turn one-time buyers into repeat customers.

- **Bring Back Loyalty Programs:** The data shows loyal customers are worth keeping. Reinvest in loyalty campaigns, rewards, and VIP perks.

- **Analyze What Changed:** The drop in performance for later customer groups needs investigation. Was it a pricing change? A product update? Something went wrong.

- **Don't Just Attract — Retain:** Acquiring customers is important, but keeping them matters more. It's more profitable to keep existing buyers happy than to keep finding new ones.
